	<h1>In progress :)</h1>
<p>By now, you should have worked collaboratively with stakeholders + team members to develop a rough sense of what the site should look like + how a user should navigate through it.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of project, this may be enough of a design phase to start developing a website. However, for projects that are larger, more complex, more aesthetically particular, or generally more bespoke, it is useful to develop more polished wireframes or even <em>interactive prototypes</em>.</p>
<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>As we began to see in the last section, wireframes are visual outlines of your interface. Similar to a floorplan, they use lines, rectangles, + written labels to indicate what goes where on each page of your site.</p>
<p><strong>insert wireframe image here</strong></p>
<p>Wireframes are great for solidifying a plan for a project, and can be especially helpful to include for projects that are appearing in:</p>
<ul>
<li>grant applications</li>
<li>project proposals</li>
<li>tenure files</li>
<li>portfolios of project contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>...in short, anywhere that you may want to lend legitimacy to a project in-process. Wireframes show that a project team knows what it's doing, and is approaching the site design process thoughtfully.</p>
