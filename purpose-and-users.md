## Identifying audiences

The first formal step in any project design process should always be to think about audience, or users. This is one of those questions that seems fairly obvious, but can end up being more complex than expected. When working with faculty, a PI may state that a project is "for" an intended audience, but in the course of conversation, it becomes apparent that they have someone entirely different in mind. 

### A non-exhaustive list of common audiences to keep in mind for our context:
- Peer audiences - such as other academics in the field, or related fields
- Students - who may be using the site in different ways
- Community members who may be represented in the project in some way
- Activists
- Independent researchers
- Other audiences who are related to the specific project in some way
- The researcher(s) themselves - we are also our own audiences, and that's okay!

Whenever possible, encourage collaborators to think about audiences plurally. In other words, it's good to consider multiple types of people who may be interested in a project (community members AND academics, or activists AND students). There is only one answer that is unacceptable for the question of audience: _everyone_.

It is also important, when considering audience, to consider whom we are talking _to_ and whom we are talking _about_. In other words, if a project or study contains information _about_ a particular population of people, it is ethically important to ensure that this population is included in our list of intended audiences, and that we are accounting for how they can access the project. If a PI has not considered this, we need to make sure that they begin thinking about it and understand why it is important.

In general, I would recommend identifying one primary audience and up to two additional audiences. 

### Some questions to ask when identifying audiences:
- What is the goal of this project?
	- Pay attention to who is named in the answer. e.g., "the goal is for _students_ to be able to..."
- If this project has been ongoing, who has been using it so far?
- Is this project fulfilling a specific need? For whom?
- When you talk about this project, whom do you imagine yourself talking to?
- Are there people for whom this work has previously been inaccessible who should have access to it?
- Are there communities that are the subject of this work who should have access to it?
