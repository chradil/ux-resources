# In progress :) 

By now, you should have worked collaboratively with stakeholders + team members to develop a rough sense of what the site should look like + how a user should navigate through it. 

Depending on the type of project, this may be enough of a design phase to start developing a website. However, for projects that are larger, more complex, more aesthetically particular, or generally more bespoke, it is useful to develop more polished wireframes or even _interactive prototypes_.

## Wireframes

As we began to see in the last section, wireframes are visual outlines of your interface. Similar to a floorplan, they use lines, rectangles, + written labels to indicate what goes where on each page of your site.

Wireframes are great for solidifying a plan for a project, and can be especially helpful to include for projects that are appearing in:
- grant applications
- project proposals
- tenure files 
- portfolios of project contributors

...in short, anywhere that you may want to lend legitimacy to a project in-process. Wireframes show that a project team knows what it's doing, and is approaching the site design process thoughtfully.
